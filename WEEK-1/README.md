# Week 1 – VAPT Fundamentals and Environment Setup

This directory contains the Week 1 submission for the VAPT internship program.

The original requirement for this week was to study core Vulnerability
Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) concepts, set up a testing
environment, perform basic vulnerability scanning, conduct risk assessment,
and submit a structured report as a PDF file.

The completed report was submitted directly to the program manager via Slack DM
as instructed and is included here for repository consistency and verification.

## Submission Notes

- Original submission method: Direct PDF submission via Slack DM to the manager  
- Current inclusion: Added to GitHub repository to support the final internship
  form submission and weekly link requirement  

> **Note:** During Week 1, the required submission format was a single PDF report
> shared directly with the manager. As no GitHub structure, subdirectories, or
> capstone-style breakdown was requested at the time, the work is preserved here
> in its original format.
