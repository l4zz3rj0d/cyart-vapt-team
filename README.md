# Week 2 – Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## Objective
To perform a complete VAPT cycle including scanning, reconnaissance,
exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting using a controlled lab setup.

## Environment
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Target: Metasploitable2, DVWA
- Network: Host-only

## Methodology
- Reconnaissance
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Exploitation
- Post-Exploitation
- Reporting

## Tools
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- OpenVAS
- sqlmap

## Repository Structure
1. Theory – Conceptual understanding and methodology
2. Scanning – Vulnerability identification and analysis
3. Recon – OSINT and asset mapping
4. Exploitation – Vulnerability validation
5. Post-Exploitation – Evidence collection
6. Capstone – Full VAPT cycle
