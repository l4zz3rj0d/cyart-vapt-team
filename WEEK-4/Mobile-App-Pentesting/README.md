# Mobile Application Penetration Testing (DVAA)
## Overview

This directory documents a mobile application security assessment conducted against the Damn insecure and vulnerable App (DIVA) in a controlled lab environment.
The objective of this exercise was to demonstrate practical mobile security testing techniques using both static and dynamic analysis, aligned with the OWASP Mobile Top 10.

## Scope and Environment

- Target Application: Damn Vulnerable Android App (DVAA / DIVA)

- Platform: Android Emulator (Genymotion)

### Testing Methodology:

- Static analysis (APK reverse engineering)

- Dynamic analysis (runtime behavior and logging inspection)

## Tools Used

- adb (Android Debug Bridge)

- Android Emulator (Genymotion)

- Linux Terminal (Kali)

Vulnerability 1: Insecure Logging
Objective

Identify whether the application logs sensitive information such as financial data during runtime.

Step 1: Navigating to the vulnerable feature

The Insecure Logging module was opened inside the application.

Step 2: Triggering the behavior

A test credit card number was entered and the Checkout button was clicked.

Step 3: Monitoring runtime logs

The following command was executed to monitor device logs:

adb logcat | grep -i credit


The log output revealed the credit card number in plaintext:

E diva-log: Error while processing transaction with credit card: 1234123412341234

Impact

Sensitive financial data is written to Logcat, which could be accessed by:

Other malicious applications

Anyone with physical/debug access to the device

This represents an Insecure Logging vulnerability (OWASP Mobile M2).

Vulnerability 2: Hardcoded Secret (Static Analysis)
Objective

Identify whether sensitive values are embedded directly into the application code.

Step 1: APK analysis using jadx

The APK was opened using:

jadx-gui DVAA.apk


During source code review, the following hardcoded value was discovered:

"vendorsecretkey"

Step 2: Locating the vulnerable activity

The AndroidManifest.xml file confirmed the relevant activity:

jakhar.aseem.diva.HardcodeActivity

Step 3: Exploiting the hardcoded secret

The discovered key was entered directly into the application input field.

Result:

Access granted! See you on the other side :)

Impact

Any attacker can:

Reverse engineer the APK

Extract secrets

Bypass access control mechanisms

This demonstrates a Hardcoded Secret vulnerability, commonly associated with insecure client-side trust.
