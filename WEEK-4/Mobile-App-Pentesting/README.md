# Mobile Application Penetration Testing (DVAA)
## Overview

This directory documents a mobile application security assessment conducted against the Damn insecure and vulnerable App (DIVA) in a controlled lab environment.
The objective of this exercise was to demonstrate practical mobile security testing techniques using both static and dynamic analysis, aligned with the OWASP Mobile Top 10.

## Scope and Environment

- Target Application: Damn Vulnerable Android App (DVAA / DIVA)

- Platform: Android Emulator (Genymotion)

### Testing Methodology:

- Static analysis (APK reverse engineering)

- Dynamic analysis (runtime behavior and logging inspection)

## Tools Used

- adb (Android Debug Bridge)

- Android Emulator (Genymotion)

- Linux Terminal (Kali)

## Vulnerabilities Identified
### 1. Insecure Logging (Sensitive Data Exposure)

Removing secrets from client-side code

Applying secure development practices
