# Post-Exploitation and Evidence Collection

This section documents the post-exploitation phase of the Week 3 task.
The objective of this stage was to validate the impact of the compromise,
demonstrate controlled access to the system, and collect evidence of successful
exploitation in an ethical lab environment.

---

## Shell Access Validation

Following successful exploitation, an interactive shell was obtained on the
target system.

Shell context confirmed:

```
www-data
```

![project f](/WEEK-3/Evidence/Shell_access.png)

This confirmed that commands were executing on the target system under the
context of the web server user.

---

## Phase 1: Shell Stabilization

The initial shell lacked job control and full terminal capabilities.  
The session was stabilized to allow reliable interaction, consistent command
execution, and safer validation of access.

This step demonstrates real-world post-exploitation behavior rather than relying
on an unstable one-off shell.

---

## Phase 2: System-Level Access Validation

To validate the impact of the compromise, access to sensitive system files was
demonstrated.

The following file was accessed:

```
/etc/passwd
```

![project f](/WEEK-3/Evidence/post_exploitation_file_read.png)

This confirms that attacker-controlled commands could access system-level
resources available to the compromised user account.

---

## Outcome

This post-exploitation phase demonstrated:

- Successful validation of shell access  
- Controlled interaction with the compromised system  
- Shell stabilization for reliable command execution  
- Evidence-backed proof of system-level access  
- Ethical validation of impact without exceeding scope  

This confirms that the vulnerability led to meaningful system compromise rather
than a theoretical exploit.
