# Post-Exploitation

## Objective
To demonstrate basic post-exploitation activities and evidence handling after
successful system compromise.

## Activities Performed
After gaining root-level access, a system file was accessed to demonstrate
control over the target system. A SHA-256 hash was generated to illustrate
evidence integrity and proper handling of collected artifacts.

No persistence mechanisms or system modifications were performed.

## Evidence
- Root shell access confirmation
- SHA-256 hash of a system file
