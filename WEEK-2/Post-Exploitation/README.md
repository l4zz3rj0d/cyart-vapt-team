# Post-Exploitation – Metasploitable2

## Objective
To assess the impact of the initial compromise by performing controlled
post-exploitation activities, including privilege escalation, sensitive data
access, and evidence collection, while maintaining a non-destructive approach.

---

## Initial Access Context
Following successful exploitation of the Apache Tomcat Manager service, an
initial **low-privileged shell** was obtained on the target system. Post-
exploitation activities were conducted to evaluate privilege boundaries and
identify potential misconfigurations.

---

## Privilege Escalation Analysis
System enumeration was performed to identify binaries with elevated execution
permissions. Using file permission analysis, a misconfigured **SUID binary**
was discovered.

The following command was used to identify SUID-enabled binaries:
```
find / -perm -4000 2>>/dev/null
```

- Enumeration of files with the SUID bit set revealed that **`nmap`** was owned
  by the root user and configured with SUID permissions.

This configuration allows the binary to execute with root-level privileges,
representing a critical security misconfiguration.

---

## Privilege Escalation
The identified SUID-enabled `nmap` binary was leveraged to escalate privileges.
By invoking `nmap` in interactive mode, a **root shell** was successfully
spawned.
```
tomcat55@metasploitable:/$ /usr/bin/nmap --interactive
Starting Nmap V. 4.53 ( http://insecure.org )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
nmap> !sh
whoami
root
```

Privilege escalation was verified using identity and user context validation
commands, confirming full administrative access to the system.

---

## Impact Validation
With root privileges obtained, access to sensitive system files was possible.
As part of impact validation, the system’s credential storage file was accessed:

- `/etc/shadow`

Access to this file confirms complete system compromise and exposure of user
credential hashes.

---

## Credential Exposure Assessment
During post-exploitation, the root password hash was successfully extracted
from `/etc/shadow`, confirming complete credential exposure.

The hash format indicates that it is suitable for offline password cracking
using tools such as **John the Ripper**. Due to the time-intensive nature of
offline cracking and because full system compromise was already demonstrated,
password cracking was not completed as part of this assessment.

The exposure of password hashes alone represents a critical security risk, as
an attacker could perform offline brute-force or dictionary attacks without
further interaction with the target system.



---

## Evidence Collection and Integrity
To preserve evidence integrity and support forensic validation, a cryptographic
hash of the accessed sensitive file was generated.

|     Item    |        Description        |                         Root Hash                            |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| /etc/shadow | System credential storage | `root:$1$/avpfBJ1$x0z8w5UF9Iv./DR9E9Lid.:14747:0:99999:7:::` |

---

## Result
Post-exploitation activities successfully demonstrated:
- Privilege escalation from a low-privileged user to root
- Exposure of sensitive credential storage
- Full system compromise due to insecure file permissions and misconfigurations

---

## Security Impact
This phase highlights the risks associated with:
- Improper SUID binary configuration
- Insecure privilege boundaries
- Exposure of credential material

An attacker exploiting these weaknesses could gain full administrative control
of the system without exploiting kernel-level vulnerabilities.
