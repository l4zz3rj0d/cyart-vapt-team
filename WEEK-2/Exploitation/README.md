# Exploitation – Metasploitable2

## Objective
To validate identified vulnerabilities by performing controlled exploitation
and demonstrate the real-world impact of insecure services.

## Target Information
- Target Machine: Metasploitable2
- Target IP: 192.168.56.5

## Exploitation Method
Based on the results of network scanning, an FTP service running a vulnerable
version of vsftpd (2.3.4) was identified. This service is known to contain a
backdoor vulnerability that allows remote unauthenticated access.

The vulnerability was exploited using the Metasploit Framework.

## Result
The exploitation was successful and resulted in immediate root-level shell
access on the target system. Since the initial access was obtained as root,
additional privilege escalation was not required.

## Evidence
- Metasploit module execution
- Successful session creation
- Root shell confirmation
